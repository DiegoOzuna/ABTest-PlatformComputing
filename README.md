# Final Project

PROVIDE OVERVIEW OF ASSIGNMENT HERE

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## Features

The following **required** features are completed:

- [x] Take a screenshot of each member's website and provide a label for each one (1 pt)
- [x] Create a chart displaying times per user and average (2 pt)
- [x] Devise your hypothesis (2 pt)
- [x] Create a Github repo for the final project (3 pt)

## NOTES:

<ol>
<li>the folder localusers was our initial baseline in which we evaluated our team's personal website performance against each other using our Unique_User. </li>
<li>the folder Users is our user pool; this will be used to iteratively improve our website and adjust our hypothesis made from the observations from using localusers first, and later from this folder itself as well. </li>
<li>FURTHER NOTE: in the folder Users, the Unique_Users we made in localusers will be redefined. This is due to our users needing to meet a standard structure. (Other user files will be provided with the same structure from outside the team as well) </li>
</ol>
